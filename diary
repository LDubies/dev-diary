Got inspired by a dumb pic of challenges to keep fresh and learn new programming techniques.
Started by creating a git hub account and following the tutorial for starters, keeping in mind I wanted this rep to be for my diary.
The idea of a diary never seemed to click with me, but the challenges picture mentioned a diary as a trick to stay motivated.
I actually somehow think this could work to keep me focused and not stop doing stuff after 2 days.
Come to think of it, I should also use this diary for fitness. Maybe I'll also get a sort of point system going, to rate my days for fitness
and programming prgress. Let's say a 5 star system. I'll further try to commit this and later include the picture with the challenges.
One of the easy game challenges should be a good start!
So today was definitely a 0 in fittness and I'll award myself a 3 for IT, because I started it. Hopefully hear from you tomorrow.
